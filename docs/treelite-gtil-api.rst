=====================================
General Tree Inference Library (GTIL)
=====================================

GTIL is a **reference implementation** of a prediction runtime for all Treelite models. It has the following goals:

* **Universal coverage**: GTIL shall support all tree ensemble models that can be represented as Treelite objects.
* **Accessible code**: GTIL should be written in an easy-to-read style that can be understood to a first-time contributor. We prefer code legibility to performance optimization.
* **Correct output**: As a reference implementation, GTIL should produce correct prediction outputs.
