# Acknowledgments

This page acknowledges those who provided great help in building the initial
version of Treelite:

* Treelite builds upon Hyunsu's earlier work at **Paul G. Allen School of
  Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington at Seattle**, which was performed under the
  guidance of **Carlos Guestrin** and **Arvind Krishnamurthy**.
* **Tianqi Chen** (member of DMLC) offered many great ideas for the conception
  of the project. He also provided feedback pertaining to API design.
* **Mu Li** (member of DMLC) provided advice and resources to develop Treelite
  into a full-fledged open source project.
