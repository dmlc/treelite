This page acknowledges those who provided great help in building the initial
version of treelite:

  Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington at Seattle**, which was performed under the
  guidance of **Carlos Guestrin** and **Arvind Krishnamurthy**.
* **Tianqi Chen** (member of DMLC) offered many great ideas for the conception
  of the project. He also provided feedback pertaining to API design.
